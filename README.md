# models
AML-defined models (aka Vocabularies and Dialects)

# Samples
The samples folder contains documents for instances of the different dialects/vocabularies. 

Not all samples have related dialects/vocabularies but they exists to start developing the model and providing a simple view of the information we would like to see in a certain model.
